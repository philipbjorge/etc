I was asked at an interview when I would choose to use a depth first search
over a breadth first search. I wasn't entirely sure, so I decided to do some benchmarks
on finding random nodes in various types of graphs.

Dependencies:
Networkx

500 Tests for all 36 100 node graphs takes about 2 minutes on my system
```
easy_install networkx
python TestRunner.py
Rscript Prettify.r
rm *.data
```
